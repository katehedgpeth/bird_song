Site grazed (sheep). Bird calling was perched in top of an A.tet. tree (2.5m high). Three other birds were foraging nearby on the ground among the bluebush. Birds flew in while I was at the site. Wind was strong so birds did not stay long before being blown along together towards top of the hill (to the south). c.12 Inland Dotterel were also present but were silent.\r\nAll birds appeared to be adults and in good condition. The following day a party of adults and juveniles was encountered about 1km away so the birds breed in the area.\r\n","bird-seen":"yes","animal-seen":"yes","playback-used":"no","temp":"","regnr":"","auto":"no","dvc":"","mic":"","smp":"44100"}]}
